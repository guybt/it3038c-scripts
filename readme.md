# Braiden Guy IT3038c Scripts

## Project 2
For project 2, I created a number guessing game using the python random module.
The random module comes with python, so no installation is necessary.
All you need to do is run the script and input your number.

## Project 1

I created a script to calculate free space on your hard drive.
